    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Years ago, an Italian restaurant served a dish called capellini pomodoro which I ordered often, 
       sometimes adding grilled chicken or shrimp to the pasta. This is my own quick version.</p>
    <p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Fill a large bowl with ice and cold water.</p>

    <!--Ingrediens-->
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Tomato</li>
        <li>Pasta</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Peppar</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Fill a large bowl with ice and cold water. </li>
        <li>Score a shallow "x" in the bottom of the tomatoes. Add tomatoes to the boiling water and cook uncovered 
            until skin starts to peel off, about 1 minute. Drain in a colander and immediately immerse in ice water 
            for several minutes to stop the cooking process. Peel tomatoes. </li>
        <li>Transfer peeled tomatoes to a food mill, and process until smooth. </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook angel hair pasta in the boiling water, 
            stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain, saving 1/4 cup of the pasta 
            water for the sauce. </li>
    </ol>
