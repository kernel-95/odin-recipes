    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        If you've never tried it, or you eat it infrequently, I strongly encourage you 
        to try your hand at cooking this very versatile fish. I promise you that when 
        properly prepared, catfish is "off the hook!" Try this curry recipe as an example.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Catfish</li>
        <li>Onions</li>
        <li>Seasonings</li>
        <li>Flour anf butter</li>
        <li>Fresh herbs</li>
        <li>Rice</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the 2-inch catfish pieces in a pan and cover with water, then add the onions, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and cook until the fish is tender. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the catfish to a plate and cover with foil to keep warm. </li>
        <li>Bring the cooking liquid back to a boil. Continue to let it boil until it has reduced by half, then lower the heat to keep it warm. Mix the flour, curry powder, and butter in a small bowl until it has formed a paste. Roll the paste into teaspoon-sized balls, then drop each ball into the simmering cooking liquid. Allow each ball to dissolve before adding the next one. Cook, stirring constantly, until the curry thickens to a gravy-like consistency. </li>
        <li>Ladle the gravy over the cooked catfish and hot rice. Garnish with fresh parsley to serve. </li>
    </ol>
